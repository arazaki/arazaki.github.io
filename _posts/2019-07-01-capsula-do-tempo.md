### Description

Cápsula do tempo is a franchise of self-service totem for recording messages to be delivered in the future, like a time capsule.
During an event (ie. wedding, graduation, anniversary) guests access the application through a touchscreen totem machine, record video messages, and then the totem starts to synchronize with the server (through an internet connection) that uploads the videos. On the server-side, the application schedule the videos to be sent in the future.
